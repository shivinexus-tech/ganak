# Ganak — Product Backlog

Rebuilt 2026-07-18 into a phased launch plan reflecting the owner's strategy.
Status verified against `src/kundli-app.tsx`, not assumed.

## Strategy (owner, 2026-07-18)

- **Free to start.** Hook users first, gather heavy user feedback, let real usage
  guide the roadmap.
- **Fastest path to a web launch**, leading with Panchang.
- **Phase 1 web scope:** Daily/Panchang + Prashna + Muhurat visible. Birth-chart
  section hidden until it's polished + partly monetizable.
- **Web first; Android + Apple wait a little** (after web proves out).
- **Monetize narrowly, later, and only where it costs money:** saving charts
  (needs paid storage), and possibly parts of the Jyotish section + the AI
  features (which cost per-call). Investment level still TBD.
- **Hard rule: never ads on the Panchang section.**

---

## PHASE 1 — Free web launch (Panchang + Prashna + Muhurat)

Small scope; most is already built. This is the near-term work.

- [ ] **Hide the birth-chart tab** for launch (leaves Daily + Prashna; Muhurat
      lives inside Daily). Also removes the currently-broken "Save charts" feature
      from the free tier automatically (it lives inside the Chart tab).
- [ ] **Deploy to a web host** — this IS the web launch. App only runs on
      localhost today. Static Vite build → free tier (Vercel / Netlify /
      Cloudflare Pages). No backend needed for this scope.
- [ ] **Error monitoring** — owner wants failure points logged. Phone-only means
      crashes are invisible without this. Sentry free tier or similar.
- [ ] **Analytics + a feedback channel** — owner wants "immense user input."
      Privacy-friendly analytics + an in-app feedback button/form.
- [ ] **Light privacy note** — needed once analytics is added.
- [ ] Optional polish before launch: Muhurat window labels bilingual (E-0.7).

**Not needed for Phase 1:** accounts, data persistence, backend proxy, AI,
Android. Deliberately out of scope to keep the launch fast.

---

## PHASE 2 — Broaden the free app, iterate on feedback

- [ ] **Reveal the birth-chart section** once its deep sub-section glosses are
      translated (E-0.6) and it's had a polish pass. Full Jyotish, still free.
- [ ] Prioritize new features by what Phase 1 user feedback actually asks for.
- [ ] Cheap feature candidates: **Prashnavali** (number-pick → verse, very low
      cost). Possibly **Gemstone/Remedy** if users ask.
- Still free. Still no ads on Panchang.

---

## PHASE 3 — Mobile apps (Android + Apple)

Owner will wait a little; sequence after web proves out.

- [ ] **Decide the Android/iOS route** — PWA (cheapest, installable web) vs
      Capacitor (native shell around the web app) vs React Native rewrite. This
      one choice sizes the whole epic.
- [ ] Play Store + App Store accounts, signing, store listings.
- [ ] **Legal — privacy policy + terms** (required before either store lists you).

---

## PHASE 4 — Selective monetization (only where it costs money)

Owner: hook users first; monetize narrowly. Never ads on Panchang.

- [ ] **Backend proxy** (holds API key) — prerequisite for all AI features.
- [ ] **Accounts / auth** + **real data persistence** (replaces the sandbox-only
      `window.storage`).
- [ ] **Paid: Save charts** — the first paid feature (storage costs money).
- [ ] **Paid AI features** (each costs per-call, natural to charge for):
      - AI chart explanation — ask questions about your own chart in natural language.
      - AI Muhurat free-text search — type the request in any language.
- [ ] Possibly paid: parts of the Jyotish section (TBD by demand + cost).
- [ ] Cloud Sync (needs accounts + persistence).

---

## LATER / MUCH LATER — features, not near-term

Owner explicitly deferred these.

- Gemstone / Remedy suggestions (unless Phase 2 feedback pulls it forward)
- Vastu Compass
- Numerology (out of scope for core personas)
- Sade Sati tracker — needs backend + push
- Proactive Gochar / transit **alerts** (push) — needs backend + accounts + push
  (NOTE: transit *display* already exists in the app)
- Custom Tithi + Reminders — needs push

---

## A. Done — already in the app (verified in code)

Feature exists and renders; not a claim of polish/parity.

- **Daily / Panchang** — tithi, nakshatra, yoga, karana, rise/set, Rahu/Gulika/Yama
  kalam, Abhijit, choghadiya, full panchang table, samvats.
- **Fasts & festivals** — Smarta + ISKCON traditions, 400-day scan.
- **Muhurat date-range finder** — 7 activities, Drik-validated. ✅ 2026-07-17.
- **Prashna (horary)** — verdict-first, birth-data-free. ✅ 2026-07-16.
- **Hora / planetary hours** — with advice input.
- **Gochar / transit display** — upcoming sign changes, retro/direct (display only).
- **Full birth chart (17 sub-sections)** — Kundli, Yogas, Grahas, KP sub-lords,
  KP significators, Kundali Matching / Guna Milan, Karakas, Shadbala, Special
  lagnas, Bhava Chalit, Ashtakavarga, Arudha, Rectification, BNN, Bhrigu,
  Vimshottari Dasha (+ sub-periods), plain-language Reading.
- **Divisional charts** D1–D60. **Dosha** logic in matching.
- **Bilingual hi/en** across Daily, Prashna, Muhurat + core Chart path.
  ✅ Messaging audit (3 tiers) 2026-07-18.

---

## E. Repo debt & small follow-ups

- **E-0.6 Chart deep-gloss Hindi translation** — advanced sub-section paragraphs
  (KP, Ashtakavarga, BNN, Bhrigu, Special Lagnas, Dasha levels) still English-only.
  Specialist-Hindi pass. Gates Phase 2's chart reveal.
- **E-0.7 Muhurat window labels bilingual** — "Rahu Kalam"/"Abhijit Muhurat" in
  finder results still English in Hindi mode. Tiny; optional Phase 1 polish.
- `parseMuhuratQuery` dead AI path — fetch to api.anthropic.com with no key;
  route via proxy (Phase 4) or remove.
- Startup performance — `scanPanchangCalendar` 400-day scan ~1.8s.

---

## Open decisions still needing the owner

- **Umbrella branding** — Ganak Panchang vs Ganak Jyotish vs one toggled app.
  (Recommendation on record: one app, section-labeled. Unresolved.)
- **Android route** (Phase 3) — PWA vs Capacitor vs rewrite.
- **Investment ceiling** — informs how much paid infra (Phase 4) is worth standing up.
